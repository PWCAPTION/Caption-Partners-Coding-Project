# Takehome Challenge

Below you will find two options for applications that we would like to see you build. For these exercises we aim to see how you build applications. This aims not only to measure capability but how you choose to solve the challenge. We hope to get to know you a bit better by looking at your solution.

Ideally you will spend no more than 5 hours on this, but if you feel you'd like to do more you are welcome to do so, we will however appreciate knowing if you choose to go over time.

## Things to keep in mind

- Is your code legible and to the point
- Is your code DRY
- Are your abstractions sensible
- Is the code performant
- Is your code reliable

## General Acceptance Criteria

- Have fun!
- The bulk of features work as expected, anything omitted should be documented so we understand why
- Candidate will write a small summary explaining any gaps or omissions / areas for improvement in their app they feel needs explanation. Feel free to add anything in here you think we may be interested in.
